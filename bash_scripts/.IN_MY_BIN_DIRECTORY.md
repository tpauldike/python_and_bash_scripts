# My Customized Commands
The following are the commands I use to run my bash scripts and python scripts that has been written to make certain things easier and faster.
These scripts are in my bin directory as executable files, so I only need to type in the command and hit enter to have any of them run on my CLI.

Command | Action
--- | ----
p | git add
r | git rm
s | secret message in ASCII
d | decode ASCII message
rd | git rm -r
rs | reverse string
r7 | encrypt/decrypt string by +7
l7 | encrypt/decrypt string by -7
chpy | chmod u+x *.py
`g <repo>` | git clone, used for cloning with SSH
`gpat <username> <repo>` | `git clone https://<my_pat>@github.com/<username>/<repo>.git`
e | emacs -nw

Lately, I started using `C` as well, to build some custom global commands on my command line, such as seen below:

Command | Description | Source Code
--- | --- | ---
d2b | Prompts the user for input and converts decimal to binary; it checks to ensure that the user's input is a valid one | [toBinary.c](https://github.com/tpauldike/c_and_I/blob/Topman/number_conversion/toBinary.c)
