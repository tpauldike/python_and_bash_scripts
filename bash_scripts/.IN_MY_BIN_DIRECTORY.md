# My Customized Commands
The following are the commands I use to run my bash scripts and python scripts that has been written to make certain things easier and faster.
These scripts are in my bin directory as executable files, so I only need to type in the command and hit enter to have any of them run on my CLI.
### Written in `Python` and `bash`

Command | Action
--- | ----
p | git add, git commit -m '...', and git push
r | git rm, git commit -m '...', and git push
s | make some message secret, using ASCII
d | decode ASCII message
rd | git rm -r, git commit -m '...', and git push
rs | reverse string
r7 | encrypt/decrypt string by moving each letter 7 steps forward
l7 | encrypt/decrypt string by moving each letter 7 steps backward
chpy | chmod u+x *.py
`g <repo_name_only>` | git clone, used for cloning my repo via SSH
`gpat <username> <repo>` | `git clone https://<my_pat>@github.com/<username>/<repo>.git`
e | emacs -nw (for opening emacs on your computer without having it popped out)
st | npm start

### Written in `C`
Lately, I started using `C` as well, to build some custom global commands on my command line, such as seen below:

Command | Description | Source Code
--- | --- | ---
d2b | Prompts the user for input and converts decimal to binary; it checks to ensure that the user's input is a valid one | [toBinary.c](https://github.com/tpauldike/c_and_I/blob/Topman/number_conversion/toBinary.c)
